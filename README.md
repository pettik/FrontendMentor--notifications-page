# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page

![Design preview for the Notifications page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

My challenge was to build out a notifications page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I could use any tools I liked to help me complete the challenge. So if I had something I wanted to practice, I was free to give it a go.

I ensured that my users could:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Overview

### The challenge

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by implementing a functional notifications page. I successfully incorporated the following features, demonstrating my progress and proficiency:

- **Dynamic Notification Management**: Utilized JavaScript to dynamically update the number of unread notifications and toggle between read and unread states. This was achieved by adding and removing CSS classes and manipulating the DOM effectively.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the interface adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using media queries, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implemented hover and focus states for all interactive elements, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.
- **CSS Methodology (BEM)**: Applied the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to the CSS structure, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable codebase.
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensured that all elements are keyboard accessible, improving the overall accessibility of the interface.
